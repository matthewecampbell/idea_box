# Idea Box

**Live Demo: http://mattsideabox.herokuapp.com/**

Single-page CRUD application with a Rails back-end (API) and JS/jQuery/AJAX front-end.

This was my first project using JavaScript.

## Usage
After cloning to your local machine, `cd` into the project directory and bundle
```
bundle
```
Initialize the database
```
rake db:{create,migrate}
```
Start a local server
```
rails s
```
In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.
